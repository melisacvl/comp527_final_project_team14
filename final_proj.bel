%% COMP 527 Final Project
%% Beluga mechanization for Gödel's system T 
%% Team 14: Tortoise and the Achilles

%% The goal of this tutorial is to study the extension of ordinary logic with natural numbers and recursion over natural numbers.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Questions %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% 1. Do we want to be logically oriented or programming oriented? -- naming would change
%% 2. Do we want to keep zero/succ/prim_rec or go with natIl (zero) natIr (succ) and natE (prim_rec)
%% 3. Do we leave as intrinsically typed formulation? From what I understand, if we left more ambiguous and instead had like a LF of_type then it would be extrinsic

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Objectives %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Inherit natural deduction calculus including existence and universal qualifiers
%% Implement the natural numbers (with zero and a successor)
%% Implement primitive recursion in the same way Gödel did  
%% Implement basic arithmetic operations using primitive recursion

%{ Defining addition via primitive recursion:

This doesn't run. What we want is something like:

add_nat(a,b)
base case: a = 0, return b;
a non-zero --> a= succ(m) so return add_nat(m,succ(b));

rec add_nat : [⊢ tm nat] → [⊢ tm nat] → [⊢ tm nat] =
  fn a b ⇒ case a of
    | [⊢ zero] ⇒ b
    | [⊢ succ M] ⇒
    let [⊢ B] = b in
    let [⊢ N] = [⊢ prim_rec M B ?] in
    [⊢ succ N]
;}%

% Defining addition using Beluga recursion
rec add_nat : [⊢ tm nat] → [⊢ tm nat] → [⊢ tm nat] =
fn a b ⇒ case a of
  | [⊢ zero] ⇒ b
  | [⊢ succ M] ⇒
	let [⊢ N] = add_nat [⊢ M] b in
	[⊢ succ N]
;

rec qa : [ ⊢ tm (((A ⊃ B) ∧ (A ∨ C)) ⊃ (B ∨ C)) ] = [ ⊢ ⊃I \u. (∨E (∧Er u) (\a. (∨Il (⊃E (∧El u) a))) (\c. (∨Ir c)))];
